**Bills, bills, bills**

Emily needs to manage her list of ever-growing bills. Each bill has a company name, a serial number, a sum and an isPaid field that illustrates whether the bill was paid. See below a few examples:

Digi Sport; 0A33455X; 75.00; false \
E-On; EED36677; 122.00; true \
Orange; X990TTRR; 46.00; true \
Vodafone; 1234RR55; 23.00; false \
Tcomm; TRE3EERR; 10.00; true \ 

Write a bill manager application with a console based user interface which allows to:
1. Add a new bill. A message will be shown if the bill was successfully added (1.5p). If another bill with the same serial number exists, the application should not add the bill and show a message (1.5p).
2. Show all the bills, with all their information (1p), sorted by company name (1p).
3. Show all paid bills (1p) and calculate their total (1p).
   Input at least 5 bills to your initial list of bills (from the source code).
   Write specifications and white-box tests for the following functions:
   Function to add a new bill (the repository/service function). (0.5 specification, 0.5- test)
   Function which calculates the total of paid bills. (0.5-specification, 0.5-test)
   The application must use layered architecture in order for functionalities to be graded.
   
1p- of.
